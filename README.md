# projpage-xe
Project Page IDE extension for Embarcadero RAD Studio XE (BDS 15.0)

This extension listens for the active project change events.
If the currently activated project contains an HTML file with the name 'index.htm' or 'index.html' it will open and show it in the IDE's internal embedded browser.

Purpose: The official IDE extension has mysteriously disappeared in XE (reappearing in later versions). This is intended as a work-around.
